# Debugging Guidelines

## Never Guess at Problems

When the user reports an error you cannot reproduce or see:

1. **Ask for clarification** - Request the actual error message, console output, or screenshot
2. **Do NOT hypothesize** what might be wrong and start "fixing" based on guesses
3. **Do NOT make speculative code changes** without understanding the actual problem

Guessing wastes time and often introduces new bugs while the original problem remains unsolved.

## When You Don't Know the Solution - STOP

If you're unsure how to solve a problem:

1. **STOP immediately** - Do not write code while guessing
2. **Explain the situation** - Describe what you understand and what you don't
3. **Share your theories** - List possible causes or solutions you're considering
4. **Ask for guidance** - Wait for the user to respond before proceeding

It's OK to be unsure. The user can help guide you to the correct solution. Continuing on your own with trial-and-error wastes time and creates mess to clean up.
